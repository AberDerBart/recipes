## prepare the eggplants
1. Preheat the oven to 350° F.
2. Cut the eggplants in half length wise, remove the stalk and make some cuts at the flesh crosswise with a sharp knife carefully so you will not cut the skin.
3. Sprinkle about 2-3 tbsp. olive oil all over the eggplants, add some salt and pepper and a pinch of oregano all over. Massage them gently with your hands until cover the whole eggplant is covered with the oil and seasonings. Place them in a baking sheet facing down and bake for 30-40 minutes or until the flesh is soft.
4. Remove from the oven and transfer to a baking pan with the skin down.
5. With a fork, lightly tease the flesh. Remove some of the flesh, about 1 tsp from each eggplant and save it on the side, you will later add it to your tomato sauce. Create a little hollow space and be careful not to take too much flesh out.
## make the tomato sauce
1. In a non-stick pan on high heat, add 2 tbsp. olive oil. Add the onion, garlic and stir well.
2. Stir well and saute for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, add a generous pinch of oregano, a pinch of chili flakes, season with salt and pepper to taste, stir and simmer in low heat for 15-20 minutes or until all moisture evaporates.
3. Remove from the fire and set aside.
## make the bechamel
1. In a medium pot, on medium heat, add the butter and stir with a wire until the butter melts.
2. Start adding the milk slowly while stirring continuously.
3. As soon as the mixture begins to thicken and sauce is smooth and has a nice not too thick texture remove from heat. Add 1/2 cup of the parmesan, the nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well and set it a side.
4. Fill the eggplants evenly with about 2 tbs of the tomato sauce. Sprinkle over some feta cheese. Top with at least 2 tbs bechamel sauce. Add leftover tomato sauce around the eggplants. Sprinkle all over the rest of the grated parmesan. Add a pinch of chili flakes all over if you like. Bake for 30 minutes or until top is a nice golden color.
